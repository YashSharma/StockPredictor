To get started with Data Science, I wrote this code with the help of william chen data science project. I learned a lot of things while wirting the code like Ridge regression, Lasso, Gradient boosting , Random Classifier, Blending via Platt scaling etc.
In this file, I have used the dataset of Boston Data Festival Hackathon.
